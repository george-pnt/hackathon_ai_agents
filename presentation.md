# Automated Software Dependency Analysis

## Introduction

- **Problem Statement**: Managing software dependencies is a critical aspect of modern software development. Outdated or deprecated dependencies can introduce security vulnerabilities, stability issues, and compatibility problems.

- **Challenge**: Manually auditing dependencies for deprecations and security vulnerabilities is time-consuming and prone to human error.

## Our Solution

### An Intelligent Agent for Dependency Analysis

- **Purpose**: Automatically analyze dependency manager files to identify deprecated dependencies and known security vulnerabilities.

- **Key Features**:
    - Accepts dependency files from various package managers (e.g., Composer for PHP, NPM for Javascript, Pip for Python, Maven for Java).
    - Checks each dependency against online repositories and security advisories.
    - Generates detailed reports highlighting issues and providing recommendations.
    - **CI/CD Integration**: Includes a shell script that integrates seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines like GitLab, using the Kotosumi API to automate the analysis process.

## How It Works

### Architecture Overview

1. **Input**:
    - User provides a dependency manager file (e.g., `composer.json`) or a URL to the file.

2. **Processing**:
    - **Dependency File Downloader**:
        - Downloads the dependency file from the provided URL if necessary.
    - **Dependency Extractor Tool**:
        - Parses the dependency file and extracts the list of dependencies and their versions.
    - **Dependency Checker Tool**:
        - For each dependency:
            - Checks if it is deprecated or abandoned.
            - Checks for known security vulnerabilities.

3. **Output**:
    - Generates a comprehensive report summarizing the findings.
    - Provides recommendations for updates or replacements.

### CI/CD Integration with GitLab

- **Automated Pipeline Checks**:
    - **Shell Script**: Developed a bash script that can be easily integrated into GitLab CI/CD pipelines.
    - **Functionality**:
        - Triggers the agent via the Kotosumi API.
        - Waits for the agent's response.
        - Determines whether the pipeline should succeed or fail based on the analysis results.
    - **Benefits**:
        - **Continuous Monitoring**: Ensures every code commit is checked for dependency issues.
        - **Immediate Feedback**: Developers are alerted to issues promptly, reducing the risk of deploying problematic code.

## Advantages of Our Solution

### 1. Automation

- **Saves Time**: Eliminates the need for manual checks.
- **Efficiency**: Quickly analyzes large lists of dependencies.

### 2. Early Detection

- **Security**: Identifies vulnerabilities before they become a problem.
- **Proactive Maintenance**: Alerts developers to deprecated or abandoned packages.

### 3. Seamless CI/CD Integration

- **Consistency**: Ensures dependency checks are part of the development workflow.
- **Immediate Action**: Stops problematic code from progressing through the pipeline.
- **Customization**: Easy to configure thresholds and criteria for pipeline success or failure.

### 4. Comprehensive Reporting

- **Clarity**: Provides detailed information in an easy-to-understand format.
- **Actionable Insights**: Offers recommendations for updates and replacements.

## Conclusion

- **Impact**: Enhances software security and reliability by automating dependency analysis and integrating it into CI/CD pipelines.
